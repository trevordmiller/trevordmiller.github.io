      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Bionic developer. Trevor Miller is one with the computer. He uses
          automation to organize his life like no one else. He frees his mind to
          focus on higher-order problems rather than wasting cycles on the
          minutiae of coding. Also, he constantly measures himself with several
          tools to ensure he's always improving and staying efficient. Trevor is
          a multiplier for team productivity. On a team of 3, his pragmatic
          approach to development allowed us to keep pace with teams of 10. I
          can't recommend Trevor enough, and I hope to work with him again in
          the future."

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Trevor brought a level of organization and consistency the project
          desperately needed. He helped lay down the ground work for scaling up
          the project's team size. Trevor helped me grow in my technical skills,
          my people skills and in navigating the terrain of formalizing a 'lab'
          project and taking it to production. He is the most organized
          developer I've ever met and his passion about learning has a positive
          effect on everyone around him. Trevor is a top notch engineer and has
          something that is far more rare; the emotional intelligence, optimism
          and people skills to move ideas forward."

        <p>
          "Trevor is as reliable and trustworthy as it gets. I've never met
          somebody so well organized and goal oriented. It was a pleasure
          working with him and continuing to be friends with him since. He is
          optimistic, helpful, patient, and self-aware. I also worked with him
          on a few side projects and I would happily do so again. His coding
          expertise and tech fluency was constantly impressive. If you want
          somebody who can deliver consistently great results, look no further."

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Trevor was my instructor training mentor at Egghead. I was
          immediately impressed by his kindness, but even more impressed by his
          thorough, kind, and direct feedback. Trevor was excellent at giving me
          exact and detailed instructions about how I could improve, but making
          me feel uplifted at the same time. I've also had the opportunity to
          receive feedback from Trevor on the product that I produce
          professionally, and his feedback as a user is of the same calibre. He
          is a product-oriented engineer with an incredible eye for detail and a
          loving demeanor. Trevor is intelligent and capable, but inquisitive
          and humble. He's good at what he does, but he's always ready to learn
          more."

        <p>
          "Trevor is a great guy to have on your team. Not only does he build
          complex UIs incredibly quickly but he's also an amazing communicator.
          On top of that his enthusiasm for learning means that he's always
          improving himself and his team."

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Trevor is one of the most skilled developers I've ever had the
          pleasure of working with. He has an outstanding eye for detail and the
          rare ability zoom out of any task he takes on and quickly understand
          context in relation to both the system design and the user experience.
          He's always able to build with a keen eye toward maintainability and
          efficiency. Furthermore, and more importantly, Trevor is an invaluable
          asset as a team member. He never hesitates to document his work, and
          he's a great pair and mentor for other developers. He takes a strong
          role in building a great team culture in ways big and small. He's
          always willing to speak up and to contribute to building processes
          that make work better for everyone around him and our whole team is
          better for having worked with him."
